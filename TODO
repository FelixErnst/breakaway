Amy's To Do List

Goal: Turn the distribution on github into a fully-fledged CRAN-compatible distribution

 Steps (approximately in order of necessity)
- create man files for everything using roxygen  commenting (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html)
- fix the NAMESPACE file
- fix the importing MASS issue in order to get mvrnorm (probably a better way to use it only for negative binomial version)
-  turn stamps lab into vignette

Other important things to do
- move all objective bayes files into streamlined functions
- move all betta drawing files into streamlined functions
- move all wlrm files into streamlined file
-  consider moving breakaway files into streamlined version
- integrate phyloseq objects as inputs
- probably way more things that will occur to me as soon as I move on to something else :)
