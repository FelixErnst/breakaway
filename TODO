Amy's To Do List

Goal: Turn the distribution on github into a fully-fledged CRAN-compatible distribution

 Steps (approximately in order of necessity)
- create man files for objective Bayes fns
- streamline breakaway, nof1
- streamline OB fns
- turn stamps lab into vignette
- create estimator S4 class and put breakaway, chao, etc, into this

Other important things to do
- move all objective bayes files into streamlined functions
- integrate phyloseq objects as inputs
- probably way more things that will occur to me as soon as I move on to something else :)
