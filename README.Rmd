[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/breakaway)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=breakaway)



`breakaway` is the premier package for statistical analysis of microbial diversity. `breakaway` implements the latest and greatest estimates of richness, as well as the most commonly used estimates.
Understanding the drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome analysis.

[`DivNet`](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) is a new package by the same authors for estimating Shannon diversity, and other diversity indices. `breakaway` focuses on richness while `DivNet` focuses on Shannon, Simpson, and other alpha diversities as well as some beta diversity indices. Check it out!

`breakaway` has undergone substantial renovations to make it more modern, easy-to-use, and robust. If functionality that you previously enjoyed in `breakaway` no longer exists, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway/issues)!

## Installation

### Development version
You can install `breakaway` from github with:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adw96/breakaway")
```

`breakaway` is actively maintained and continually expanding and developing its scope! Is there a method you would like to have implemented in breakaway? Submit a pull request or contact the [maintainer](http://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/)!

### Documentation

The best place to start is the [vignettes](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway/tree/master/vignettes) directory. After loading the package, type `vignette("intro-diversity-estimation")` to load the vignette!

Documentation for functions can be found in the [man](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway/tree/master/man) directory. A pdf of all documentation can be found in [breakaway-manual.pdf](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway/tree/master/breakaway-manual.pdf) directory for easy viewing on the web.

### CRAN

For now, `breakaway` is no longer being updated on CRAN. You can access v3.0 on CRAN [here](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=breakaway) or with `install.packages("breakaway")`.
