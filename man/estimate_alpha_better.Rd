\title{Estimate alpha diversity}
\usage{
estimate_alpha_better(physeq, split = TRUE, measures = NULL,
  estimators = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{(Required). \code{\link{phyloseq-class}}, or alternatively,
an \code{\link{otu_table-class}}. The data about which you want to estimate
the richness.}

\item{split}{(Optional). Logical. Should a separate set of richness estimates
be performed for each sample? Or alternatively, pool all samples and
estimate richness of the entire set.}

\item{measures}{(Optional). Default is \code{NULL}, meaning that
all available alpha-diversity measures will be included.
Alternatively, you can specify one or more measures
as a character vector of measure names.
Values must be among those supported:
\code{c("Observed", "Chao1", "ACE", "Shannon", "Simpson", "InvSimpson", "Fisher")}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of the richness estimates, and their standard error.
}
\description{
Estimates a number of standard alpha diversity in a statistically rigourous way,
and returns the results as a \code{data.frame}.
Strictly speaking, this function is not only estimating richness,
despite its name.
It can operate on the cumulative population of all
samples in the dataset, or by repeating the richness estimates for each
sample individually.
NOTE: You must use untrimmed datasets
for meaningful results, as these estimates (and even the ``observed'' richness)
are highly dependent on the number of singletons. You can always trim the data
later on if needed, just not before using this function.

 with method-specific error-bars.
