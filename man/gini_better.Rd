\description{
In many ecological surveys, only a small fraction of the total ecosystem is
observed. In order to draw conclusions about the total ecosystem, it is
necessary to adjust for inexhaustive sampling in estimates of alpha
diversity. This function implements such an adjustment for the Gini-Simpson
index.
