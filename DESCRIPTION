Description: Understanding the drivers of microbial diversity is an important 
    frontier of microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples 
    from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome analysis. 
    `breakaway` is the premier package for statistical analysis of microbial 
    diversity. `breakaway` implements the latest and greatest estimates of 
    species richness, as well as the most commonly used estimates.
