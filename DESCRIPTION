Description: Species richness estimation is an important problem in biodiversity
    analysis. This package provides methods for total species richness estimation
    (observed plus unobserved) and a method for modelling total diversity with
    covariates. breakaway() estimates total (observed plus unobserved) species
    richness. Microbial diversity datasets are characterized by a large number of
    rare species and a small number of highly abundant species. The class of models
    implemented by breakaway() is flexible enough to model both these features.
    breakaway_nof1() implements a similar procedure however does not require a
    singleton count. betta() provides a method for modelling total diversity with
    covariates in a way that accounts for its estimated nature and thus accounts for
    unobserved taxa, and betta_random() permits random effects modelling.
